### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-project.git
```

### Branching Convention

We follow a clear branching convention to organize our development process and manage changes effectively. Here are the standard branch types and their purposes:

1. **`main`**: The main development branch that represents the production-ready codebase. This branch should always be stable.

2. **`dev`**: The development branch where developers create feature and bugfix branches. The `dev` branch acts as a staging area for ongoing development.

3. **`feature/feature-name`**: Branch for adding new features or enhancements. When working on a new feature, create a branch from `dev` with a name that reflects the feature being implemented, e.g., `feature/shopping-cart`.

4. **`bugfix/bug-description`**: Branch for fixing bugs and issues. The branch name should describe the bug or issue being addressed, e.g., `bugfix/checkout-validation-issue`.

5. **`hotfix/hotfix-description`**: Branch for critical bug fixes that need immediate attention. The branch name should describe the issue, e.g., `hotfix/payment-gateway-issue`.

6. **`release/release-version`**: Branch for release preparation. When preparing for a new release, create a branch from `dev` named after the version number, e.g., `release/v1.0.0`. This branch should only contain release-related changes.

### Workflow

Here's the recommended workflow for creating and merging branches:

1. Create a new branch from `dev` for your feature or bug fix.
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in the feature or bugfix branch.

3. Commit your changes and push them to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to `dev` for review. Provide a clear description of the changes and reference any related issues or feature requests.

5. Once the PR is approved and passes any required tests, it can be merged into `dev`.

6. Periodically, the `dev` branch is reviewed and tested as a whole. When the `dev` branch is considered stable, it can be merged into `main` to represent a new release version.

7. Delete the feature or bugfix branch after it has been merged.

8. Regularly update your local `dev` branch to include the latest changes from the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   ```

This branching convention and workflow help keep development organized, ensuring that changes are reviewed and tested before merging into the production-ready `main` branch.

### Creating a Pull Request (PR)

**Step 1: Branch Creation**

Before you create a PR, make sure you have a branch where you've made your changes. Typically, developers create feature or bugfix branches based on the `dev` branch. You can use the following commands to create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
# Start from the dev branch
git checkout dev

# Create and switch to your feature branch (replace 'feature/your-feature-name' with the actual branch name)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Step 2: Commit Your Changes**

Make the necessary changes to your code and commit them to your feature branch. Use meaningful commit messages to describe what you've done. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add shopping cart functionality"
```

**Step 3: Push Your Branch**

Push your feature branch to the remote repository on GitHub (or your chosen platform) using:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**Step 4: Creating the Pull Request**

1. Go to the project's repository on GitHub or your chosen platform.

2. You should see a prompt to create a new Pull Request on the main project page. Click on it.

3. Select your feature branch (`feature/your-feature-name`) as the source branch.

4. Select the `dev` branch as the target branch. This is where your changes will be merged once the PR is approved.

5. Give your PR a descriptive title that summarizes the changes you made.

6. In the description, provide more details about the changes you've made, any related issues, and why this PR is necessary. Be clear and informative.

7. Reviewers: Assign one or more reviewers to your PR. These are typically other team members who will review your code.

8. Labels: Add labels to your PR if your project uses them for categorization (e.g., "bugfix," "enhancement").

9. Review Requests: If you want specific team members to review your code, you can request their reviews.

10. Once you're satisfied with the PR details, click "Create Pull Request."

**Step 5: Review and Iteration**

Your reviewers will receive a notification and start reviewing your changes. They may suggest improvements, ask questions, or approve the PR.

If changes are requested, make the necessary adjustments and push the changes to the same feature branch. The PR will be automatically updated.

**Step 6: Merging**

Once the PR is approved and all discussions are resolved, you can merge it into the `dev` branch. Click the "Merge" button on the PR page. Depending on your project's settings, you may have different merge options, such as "Squash and Merge" or "Rebase and Merge."

**Step 7: Deleting the Branch**

After the PR is merged, it's a good practice to delete your feature branch. You can usually do this from the PR page.

That's the basic process of creating a Pull Request in your project. It's a crucial step for code review and collaboration, ensuring that changes are well-documented and tested before being merged into the main codebase.

### Coding Standards

We follow a set of coding standards to maintain consistency and readability in the codebase. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Code Formatting**: We use IntelliJ IDEA with the provided formatter file for code formatting. Make sure your code is formatted with 4 spaces for indentation.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Class names should be in CamelCase (e.g., `ProductService`).
   - Variable names should be in camelCase (e.g., `totalAmount`).
   - Constants should be in UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PRODUCT_QUANTITY`).

3. **Comments**: Add meaningful comments to your code, especially in complex or non-obvious sections. Use JavaDoc-style comments for methods and classes.

4. **Exception Handling**: Properly handle exceptions and errors. Document expected exceptions and error-handling strategies.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your code using JUnit. Ensure good test coverage.

6. **Dependency Management**: Declare and manage project dependencies using Maven. Ensure that your `pom.xml` is up-to-date with accurate dependency versions.

7. **Version Control**: Use clear and concise commit messages following these standards:
   - Start with a capital letter.
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
   - Reference relevant issues or feature requests. For example, "Fix #123: Handle null values in user profiles."

Please review these coding standards before contributing to the project. Consistency in coding practices and informative commit messages helps maintain the quality and readability of our codebase.

### Documentation

Mention where to find project documentation, such as API documentation or architecture diagrams.

### License

Specify the project's license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) and include a link to the full license text.

Remember to keep your README up to date as the project evolves, and ensure that it's clear and user-friendly to help new contributors and users understand your project better.
